# Multiple linear regression
Question:
A researcher wants to determine the factors that influence a person's income.

The researcher has collected data on income, age, education level, and years of experience for a sample of 200 individuals. Using multiple linear
regression, determine the relationship between income and the other variables.

# Solution:

To solve this question, we need to use multiple linear regression. The general form of the multiple linear regression equation is:

y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + ... + βnxn + ε

where:

y is the dependent variable (income in this case)

x1, x2, x3, ..., xn are the independent variables (age, education level, and years of experience in this case)

β0, β1, β2, β3, ..., βn are the regression coefficients

ε is the error term

To perform the regression analysis, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Check the assumptions of multiple linear regression


Linearity: The relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable should be linear

Independence: The observations should be independent of each other

Homoscedasticity: The variance of the error term should be constant for all values of the independent variables

Normality: The error term should be normally distributed

Step 2: Build the regression model


We can use software like R or Python to build the regression model. The output will give us the regression coefficients, their standard errors, and their

p-values. We can use these values to determine the statistical significance of the independent variables.

Step 3: Interpret the results

We can interpret the results by looking at the regression coefficients and their p-values. A positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship between

the independent variable and the dependent variable, while a negative coefficient indicates a negative relationship. The p-value tells us the probability

of observing a coefficient as extreme or more extreme than the one we observed, assuming that the null hypothesis (the coefficient is zero) is true.

For example, the regression output might look like this:

Coefficients:


Estimate Std. Error t-value Pr(>|t|)

(Intercept) 3.712e+04 1.274e+03 29.153 <2e-16 ***

Signif. codes: 0 ‘’ 0.001 ‘’ 0.01 ‘’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

From the output, we can see that all three independent variables (age, education level, and years of experience) are statistically significant, as

indicated by their p-values being less than 0.05. We can interpret the regression coefficients as follows:

The intercept is the predicted income for someone with zero age, zero education, and zero years of experience. In this case, it is $37,120.

The coefficient for age is 990.7, which means that for every one-year increase in age, the predicted income increases by $990.7.

The coefficient for education level is 2,011, which means that for every one-unit increase in education level (e.g., from high
